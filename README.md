System Overview
The objective of the project is to develop a WEB Application where the user will be able to create and use his own learning cards (flashcards).

Learning cards, also known as flashcards, educational cards, study cards, memorization cards or mnemonic cards are cards
that contain words, images, symbols or numbers on one or both sides and are used to acquire knowledge by memorizing their
content through the spaced repetition of the set of cards.

On one side of the card the user enters a question and on the other side the answer. It can also be used to train vocabulary
when learning new languages, indicating on one side the word in a language and on the other the meaning or translation.

In the application to be developed, the user will have to create an account in the application, and once logged in, he will
be able to add new cards, create categories to classify them and use them for his studies.

The application will allow to filter the cards by categories, showing the part of the question and then, the user will turn
the card over, to show his answer, indicating if the answer has been correct or not. In addition, the system should store
the number of correct answers for each card, offering the user the cards according to the number of correct answers,
being that the less correct cards should appear more frequently than the more correct ones.

The project consists of a back end developed in Java with Spring Boot and a front end developed in React.
